# NSGAIII-EHVI
NSGAIII-EHVI is an expensive many-objective optimization algorithm.  The algorithm is based on the NSGA-III optimizer, applying a high dimensional expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) criterion for infill.  

More details are shown in the paper "An Expensive Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm Based on Efficient Expected Hypervolume Improvement"
